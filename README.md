# Analysis of the Effectiveness of a Digital Training Tool (wecoach)

Overview

This repository contains the R code and data processing scripts developed for the analysis conducted in my master's thesis (2020). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital training tool for leaders and teams (wecoach) in enhancing a leader's self-efficacy in facilitating health-oriented team development.

The analysis also considered the impact of subjective and objective process and contextual factors. A particular focus of this work was placed on data cleaning and preprocessing, as well as the characterization of usage patterns.
